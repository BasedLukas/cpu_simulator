# cpu simulator  

The goal is to simulate an 8 bit CPU with a von Neumann type architecture using only logic gates and building upwards.  
All the operation should be based on the properties of the logic gates, and changing their function should lead to corresponding changes in opperation.  
Check out the docs for details.  
tests.py should run error free.  
pilot.py gives you a basic cpu.
